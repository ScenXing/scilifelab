Project status note
===================

${date}
---------------------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a project status note containing an overview of the status of your project to date. If your samples are sequenced on multiple flowcells, you may receive
a project status note after each delivery.

Project overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:Project name: ${project_name}
:Customer reference: ${'{}'.format(customer_reference) if customer_reference not in ['', 'N/A'] else 'N/A'}
:Application: ${application}
${':Sequencing lanes ordered: {}'.format(lanes_ordered) if lanes_ordered else ''}
${':Number of samples: {}'.format(no_samples) if no_samples else ''}
:UPPNEX project id: ${uppnex_project_id}
:Project path: /proj/${uppnex_project_id}/INBOX/${project_name}

Sequencing lanes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Below, you will find a summary of the sequencing lanes that have been run to date for the ${project_name} project.

Data delivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data from the sequencing are uploaded to the UPPNEX (UPPMAX Next
Generation sequence Cluster Storage, www.uppmax.uu.se), from which the
user can access it. If you have problems to access your data, please
contact SciLifeLab genomics_support@scilifelab.se. If you have
questions regarding UPPNEX, please contact support@uppmax.uu.se.
Detailed information on how to access your data can be found in the `Sequencing FAQ`_ 
as well as in the sample delivery note that you received together with each delivery.
